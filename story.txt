Once upon the time, there was a person that really likes funiculars. 
"It's funny that someone thinks funiculars are not spectacular" they thought, while riding a funicular.
"I'll show them!" they vowed, "I'll show them all."
They proceeded to build the mythical oracular funicular that rivals all similar.
They named it "Supreme Funicular" and it became very popular.
Travelers paid regular visit to this funicular and had jocular experiences.
