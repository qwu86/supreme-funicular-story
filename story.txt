Once upon the time, there was a person that really likes funiculars. 
"It's funny that someone thinks funiculars are not spectacular" they thought, while riding a funicular.
"I'll show them!" they vowed, "I'll show them all."
They proceeded to build the mythical oracular funicular that rivals all similar.
They named it "Supreme Funicular" and it became very popular.
Travelers paid regular visit to this funicular and had jocular experiences.

This person was so happy how successful his "Supreme Funicular" turned out that 
he decided to build an "Ultra Supreme Funicular". It would be more spectacular
than any funicular to date. It took years to build the "Ultra Supreme 
Funicular", but it was finally complete and everyone was excited to ride the
"Ultra Supreme Funicular". The person finally unveiled it to the crowd and they
could not believe their eyes.

As the door to the ultimate funicular opened, presented in front of the crowd
is an orbicular funicular in paricular. Not like any regular funicular that
bored blase travelers, the ultra supreme funicular was designed by popular 
chiselers and jewelers. Its secular design was a huge success and got a titular
nomination by the chanceller.
